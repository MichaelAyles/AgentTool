## Technical Debt Mitigation

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and can be replaced
2. **Plugin System**: Extensible adapter architecture prevents vendor lock-in
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage prevents runtime errors
4. **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through events enables future enhancements
5. **Stateless Design**: Scalable architecture for future growth

### Code Quality Measures

- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Automated code quality checks
- Regular dependency updates
- Performance benchmarking
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Documentation Standards

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API documentation with OpenAPI
- Component documentation with Storybook
- Developer onboarding guides
- User tutorials and examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Process Management Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and monitoring
   - Fallback: Graceful degradation and error recovery

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Security-first design and regular audits
   - Fallback: Immediate patching and incident response

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing and optimization
   - Fallback: Horizontal scaling and load balancing

### Operational Risks

1. **Adapter Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Standardized adapter interface and testing
   - Fallback: Adapter versioning and backward compatibility

2. **User Experience Complexity**
   - Mitigation: User testing and iterative design
   - Fallback: Progressive disclosure and help system

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Response time < 100ms for API calls
- Terminal latency < 50ms for interactive sessions
- 99.9% uptime for production deployment
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- < 2GB memory usage per active session

### User Metrics

- Adapter ecosystem growth (>10 adapters in 6 months)
- User adoption rate (>1000 users in first year)
- Session success rate (>95% of sessions complete successfully)
- User satisfaction score (>4.5/5)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Set up development environment
   - Create initial project structure
   - Begin backend service implementation

2. **First Milestone** (End of Week 4):
