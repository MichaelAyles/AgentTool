# Vibe Coding App - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A browser-based coding environment that connects to local development environments via UUID pairing. The frontend is hosted on Vercel as a static site, while the backend runs locally on the user's machine (Mac/Linux/WSL) and streams data to the frontend.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Vercel Static Site)
- **Technology Stack**: React/Vue/Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS
- **Hosting**: Vercel static deployment
- **Core Features**:
  - UUID-based session management
  - Terminal interface in browser
  - Connection status indicator
  - Setup script generation

### Backend (Desktop Connector)
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js/Python/Go (TBD)
- **Deployment**: Local installation on user's machine
- **Core Features**:
  - Terminal session management
  - WebSocket server for real-time communication
  - Local database for session persistence
  - UUID generation and pairing
  - Security layer for browser connections

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
**Goal**: Basic terminal access through browser with UUID pairing

#### 1.1 Frontend Infrastructure
- Static site structure for Vercel deployment
- Basic UI with connection interface
- UUID input/display functionality
- Connection status indicators

#### 1.2 Desktop Connector Core
- Local server setup (WebSocket/HTTP)
- UUID generation and management
- Basic terminal session spawning
- Local database initialization

#### 1.3 Communication Layer
- WebSocket connection between frontend and desktop connector
- UUID-based session pairing
- Basic terminal I/O streaming
- Connection health monitoring

### Phase 2: Enhanced Terminal Experience
**Goal**: Full-featured terminal with persistence and multi-session support

#### 2.1 Terminal Features
- Multiple terminal sessions
- Session persistence across reconnections
- Terminal history and scrollback
- Copy/paste functionality
- Terminal resizing and theming

#### 2.2 Session Management
- Session listing and switching
- Session naming and organization
- Auto-reconnection on disconnect
- Session cleanup and garbage collection

### Phase 3: Vibe Coding Features (Future)
**Goal**: Enhanced coding experience with IDE-like features

#### 3.1 File System Integration
- File browser in web interface
- Basic file editing capabilities
- Syntax highlighting
- File upload/download

#### 3.2 Development Tools
- Git integration
- Process monitoring
- Log viewing
- Environment variable management

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- UUID-based authentication prevents unauthorized access
- Local-only connections (no external network exposure)
- CORS configuration for Vercel frontend
- Input sanitization for terminal commands

### Performance
- Efficient WebSocket message handling
- Terminal output buffering and streaming
- Connection pooling for multiple sessions
- Memory management for long-running sessions

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Support for Mac, Linux, and WSL environments
- Platform-specific terminal spawning
- Path handling across different filesystems
- Shell detection and configuration

## Deployment Strategy

### Frontend Deployment
1. Vercel static site deployment
2. Environment-specific configuration
3. CDN optimization for global access
4. Progressive Web App (PWA) features for better UX

### Desktop Connector Distribution
1. npm package for easy installation
2. Standalone executables for non-Node.js users
3. Auto-update mechanism
4. Installation scripts with setup automation

## Success Metrics
- Successful UUID pairing between frontend and desktop connector
- Real-time terminal I/O with minimal latency
- Stable WebSocket connections with auto-reconnect
- Cross-platform compatibility verification
- User-friendly setup and connection process
