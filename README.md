# Vibe Coding App

A browser-based terminal interface that connects to your local development environment via UUID pairing. Access your terminal from anywhere with a secure, real-time connection.

## Overview

Vibe Coding App consists of two main components:
- **Frontend**: A static web application hosted on Vercel that provides the browser-based terminal interface
- **Desktop Connector**: A local application that runs on your machine and provides secure terminal access

## Features

### Current Features (Planned)
- 🔗 UUID-based session pairing
- 💻 Real-time terminal access through browser
- 🔄 WebSocket-based streaming for low latency
- 💾 Local session persistence
- 🌐 Cross-platform support (Mac, Linux, WSL)
- 🔒 Secure local-only connections

### Future Features
- 📁 File system browser
- 🎨 Terminal themes and customization
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design
- 🔧 Multi-session support
- 📊 Process monitoring
- 🌙 Dark/light mode toggle

## Quick Start

### 1. Access the Web Interface
Visit the hosted application at: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`

### 2. Install Desktop Connector
Choose your installation method:

#### Option A: Using npm (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g vibe-coding-connector
vibe-connector start
```

#### Option B: Using setup script
Copy and run the setup script provided in the web interface.

### 3. Connect
1. Start the desktop connector on your local machine
2. Copy the UUID from the connector output
3. Enter the UUID in the web interface
4. Start coding!

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for desktop connector)
- Modern web browser
- Mac, Linux, or WSL environment

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vibe-coding-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development servers:
```bash
# Frontend development
npm run dev:frontend

# Desktop connector development
npm run dev:connector
```

## Security

- **Local Only**: The desktop connector only accepts connections from localhost
- **UUID Authentication**: Each session requires a unique UUID for access
- **No External Exposure**: Your terminal is never exposed to the internet
- **Session Isolation**: Each UUID creates an isolated session

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend is automatically deployed to Vercel on push to main branch.

### Desktop Connector
Distributed as:
- npm package for easy installation
- Standalone executables for various platforms
- Docker container for containerized environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot connect to desktop connector:**
1. Ensure the connector is running locally
2. Check that the UUID matches exactly
3. Verify no firewall is blocking local connections
4. Try restarting the connector

**Terminal not responding:**
1. Check WebSocket connection status
2. Restart the desktop connector
3. Refresh the browser page
4. Check browser console for errors

**Setup script fails:**
1. Ensure you have proper permissions to install packages
2. Check internet connection for package downloads
3. Try manual installation method
4. Refer to platform-specific installation guides
